Regression Project
Applying supervised learning to solve a regression problem based.

In this repo we look at applying a variety of SupervisedLearning models to predict car-price.  

(This is a specific implementation of the general model comparison: https://github.com/Tawfiqh/ML-Model-Comparison)

# Setup
I used this dataset from Kaggle for car prices:
https://www.kaggle.com/CooperUnion/cardataset
(save it in the root directory as "car_data.csv")

If using pyenv install with 
```
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the project by running:
```
$ python3 main.py
```



The following models were run on the dataset:
    - K-Nearest-Neighbours
    - Linear Regression
    - Decision Tree
    - Random Forest
    - SVR
