Regression Project
Applying supervised learning to solve a regression problem based.

In this repo we look at applying a variety of SupervisedLearning models to predict car-price.

I used this dataset from Kaggle for car prices:
https://www.kaggle.com/CooperUnion/cardataset
(save it in the root directory as "car_data.csv")

Run the project by running:
```
$ python3 main.py
```


The following models were run on the dataset:
    - K-Nearest-Neighbours
    - Linear Regression
    - Decision Tree
    - Random Forest
    - SVR
